    <h2>Prerequisite </h2>
    You can try running this app at your own <b>node version</b> that you have.<br />
    If not, you can try installing node version 6.3.0 at the following link
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.3.0/">https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.3.0/</a> as I build this application on it, on the site scroll to below until you find the installer respective to the OS.

    <h2> Running this App </h2>
    Go to the main project directory and do
    <pre>
    cd server
    </pre>
    Inside "server" directory do
    <pre>
    npm install
    npm start
    </pre>
    than click at the <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a> you should see my application running. :) <br />
    <i> installation won't take long as you're only installing an 'express module' because the files(js, css, images) are already bundle into a single JS file</i>
</p>

<p>
    <h2> Running the unit test </h2>
    Go to the main project directory and do
    <pre>
    npm install
    npm test
    </pre>
    You should be able to see the unit test execution in cmd or terminal <br />
    <i> installation will take time as it has to install all the required dependecies stated at package.json file in main directory </i>
</p>

<p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    The development code(React,Redux, SASS) is place at "src" folder whereas the unit tests(enzyme) are place at "test" folder.<br />
    The development code is compress into a single JS file(app.min.js) at "dist" directory using the beauty of webpack :) so that it can be served at the express server.
    Most of my files prefix name starts with 'LT' or 'lt', it stands for League Table.
